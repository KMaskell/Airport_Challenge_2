In general you shouldn't be stubbing out behaviour on the object under test.  The two key exceptions are when you have randomness or a 3rd party API.  There are at least three different levels we can stub out the interaction with a 3rd party API such as Twilio (used for sending SMS messages).  Say that we are using the Twilio gem liks so:

```ruby 
class Takeaway

  def complete_order
    send_text("Thank you for your order: £#{total_price}")
  end

  def send_text(message)
    Twilio::REST::Client.new(ENV['TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID'], ENV['TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN'])
      .messages.create(
        from: ENV['TWILIO_PHONE'],
        to: ENV['TWILIO_DESTINATION_PHONE'],
        body: message
      )
  end

  ...
end
```

And test of complete_order will have the side effect of sending an SMS.  The simplest way to avoid this is to stub out like so:

```ruby
describe Takeaway
  subject(:takeaway) { described_class.new }
  it 'sends a payment confirmation text message' do
    expect(takeaway).to receive(:send_text).with("Thank you for your order: £20.93")
    takeaway.complete_order(20.93)
  end
end
```

This ensures that Takeaway#complete_order gets some test coverage and that no SMS will be sent by our tests.  This is acceptable, but we still don't have very good test coverage. 

What alternatives do we have?  One is to use some of RSpec's legacy code features like [`receive_message_chain`](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/docs/working-with-legacy-code/message-chains):

```ruby
describe Takeaway do

  let(:client) { double :client }
  it "can send text" do
    message = 'order complete'
    twilio_message_body = { from: ENV['TWILIO_PHONE'], to: ENV['TWILIO_DESTINATION_PHONE'], body: message }
    allow(client).to receive_message_chain(:messages, :create).with(twilio_message_body)
    expect(Twilio::REST::Client).to receive(:new).with(ENV['TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID'], ENV['TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN']).and_return(client)
    subject.send_text(message)
  end
end
```

This has the advantage that we have now precisely stubbed out our applications interaction with the Twilio gem, but we've got some really brittle convoluted code here.  As soon as Twilio's gem changes our application will break, but our tests will still pass.  Can we do better?

The next level up is to stub out at the network layer using a gem like [VCR](https://github.com/vcr/vcr).  This involves a non-trivial setup and there are a number of gotchas, but VCR operates so that it records all the network interactions that your application has.  Full details of operation in [VCR](https://github.com/vcr/vcr)'s README, but here's a taste:

```ruby
  it "receives a message after the order is placed" do
    VCR.use_cassette('twilio') do
      takeaway.complete_order(20.93)
    end
  end
```

configure in spec_helper like so:

```ruby
require 'vcr'
require 'webmock'

TWILIO_VARS = []
TWILIO_VARS << 'TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID'
TWILIO_VARS << 'TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN'
TWILIO_VARS << 'TWILIO_PHONE'
TWILIO_VARS << 'TWILIO_DESTINATION_PHONE'

VCR.configure do |config|
  config.cassette_library_dir = "fixtures/vcr_cassettes"
  config.hook_into :webmock 
  TWILIO_VARS.each do |var|
    config.filter_sensitive_data("<#{var}>") { ENV[var] }
  end
end
```

and when you first run the test it will generate a YAML file `fixtures/vcr_cassettes/twilio.yml` with contents like the following:

```yml

Note that on first operation the text message will be sent, but on second and subsequent usage no text message will be sent and the full stack of your app and the Twilio gem all the way down to the network layer will be exercised.  If the Twilio API or gem changes, just delete the file and re-record.

Note also that with this VCR configuration we are replacing any sensitive data in the YAML file such as our Twilio authentication ids etc.

Checking this file into version control ensures that automated CI systems will not send unwanted SMS messages (in this case) and prevent unwanted network interactions from your app (in general).
